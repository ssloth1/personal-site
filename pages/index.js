            <p className="text-xl py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 mx-auto dark:text-white">Growing up, I was always captivated by the arts - film, 
            music, painting, and video games. The idea of creating my own video game was a dream that had always fascinated me. However, as I delved 
            deeper into the complexity of what it takes to make a game, my dream felt like a distant reality. I always aspired to have the skills to 
            bring my game ideas to life, but life took me down a different path. In college, I was involved with music and politics, and I eventually 
            landed a job as a legislative aide. Although I was proud of the work I did, helping pass laws and assist constituents, I felt like something 
            was missing. I yearned for a new challenge, a way to express my creativity.</p>
            <p className="text-xl py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 mx-auto dark:text-white">It wasn&apos;t until my brother, who was studying game design, 
            came home and showed me his projects that I remembered my love for creation. The excitement around the idea of making something sparked a 
            flame in me, and I knew I had to do something about it. I started teaching myself computer science, starting with command-line courses in 
            Codecademy and then moving on to the Python course. I was hooked. I found that I loved learning about computer science and felt 
            intellectually stimulated in a way that I hadn&apos;t in a long time.</p>
            <p className="text-xl py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 mx-auto dark:text-white">That&apos;s when I discovered the Align program at Northeastern 
            University, a Master of Science in Computer Science program for people with non-CS backgrounds. I applied and was accepted, and I started 
            my journey in the fall of 2022. My first semester was filled with foundational courses in computer science and discrete mathematics, and 
            now I&apos;m taking courses related to data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design. I&apos;m also using Udemy as a resource for learning 
            game development and working on small side projects.</p>
            <p className="text-xl py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 mx-auto dark:text-white">I&apos;m so grateful for the opportunity to follow my passion 
            and pursue my dream of creating video games. I&apos;m eager to continue growing my skills and knowledge in the gaming industry and can&apos;t wait 
            to see what the future holds.</p>
